# AI Reference - Security+ Labs Project

## Documentation Standards
- **NEVER leave placeholder content** (like "[Insert screenshot here]") in final documentation
- Always ask for completion of hands-on elements before finalizing documentation
- Request actual screenshots, code outputs, or results before pushing content
- Complete all lab steps and gather real results before documenting

## Workflow Process
1. Plan the documentation structure
2. Ask user to complete hands-on lab steps
3. Request actual screenshots/outputs from completed labs
4. Only then finalize and push the complete documentation

## Current Project: Security+ Labs
- Focus on practical, hands-on security demonstrations
- Each section should include completed labs with real results
- Screenshots should show actual terminal output, not placeholders
